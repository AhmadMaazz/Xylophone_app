# xylophone_app_using_Flutter

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

The development of this application involved utilization of the audioplayers dependency. The primary focus was to explore the integration of .wav audio files into the code and to effectively incorporate them within the app. The latest version of audioplayers, v3.0.1, was utilized to ensure maximum compatibility and functionality.

The current implementation primarily concentrates on establishing a sound infrastructure within the app, with emphasis placed on the basic front-end design. The objective is to provide a solid foundation for future updates and improvements.
